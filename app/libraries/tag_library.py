This module provides the TagLibrary class for managing document tags,
including methods for extracting tags from strings, deleting all tags
associated with a specific document ID, and inserting new tags. It
employs asynchronous operations and a locking mechanism to ensure
thread safety during tag manipulations, and interacts with the
repository to handle data storage. The class is designed to support
efficient tag management during document updates and ensure
concurrency control.
