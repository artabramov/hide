"""
This module provides a custom HTTP exception class E, for detailed
error reporting in the applications. The E class extends HTTPException
to include additional error details such as location, input, type,
and HTTP status code. It defines various error codes for common issues,
including token-related errors, user status problems, resource access
issues, and value validation errors. By using this exception class,
we can deliver more granular and actionable error information in API
responses, aiding both debugging and user experience.
