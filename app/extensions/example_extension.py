"""
This module contains asynchronous extension functions that handle
various actions related to user, document, collection, comment,
download, favorite, and other entities in the application. These
functions are invoked after certain operations, such as registration,
updates, or retrievals, to perform additional tasks like logging or
processing. Each function in this module follows the pattern of
handling post-operation actions and returns the relevant entity
or list of entities.
