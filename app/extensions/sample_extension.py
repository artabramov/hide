Sample extension module for handling event hook functions triggered
by corresponding events within the application. Each function is
associated with a specific event and is designed to be executed when
that event occurs. Functions may include additional logic such as
event logging, updating the database, managing the cache, performing
file or network operations, interacting with third-party applications,
and other related actions.
