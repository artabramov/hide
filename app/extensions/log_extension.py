This module contains asynchronous functions that handle post-processing
actions for various entities, including user registrations, updates, and
logins; collection and document operations; comment management; download
tracking; and favorite interactions. Each function logs specific actions
performed on these entities, capturing details about the request,
current user, and the entity involved. The log entries are inserted into
the database for audit purposes, and the functions return the processed
entity or list of entities.
