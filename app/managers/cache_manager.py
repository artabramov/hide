This module provides the CacheManager class for managing caching
operations with Redis for SQLAlchemy entities. The CacheManager class
offers methods to set, get, delete, and delete all cached SQLAlchemy
model instances. It leverages Redis for efficient storage and retrieval
and supports asynchronous operations to enhance performance.
