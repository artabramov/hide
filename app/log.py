"""
This module sets up logging for the application with context-aware
capabilities. It configures a rotating file handler to manage log files,
ensures proper log rotation based on size, and maintains a specified
number of backup files. The logging system is enhanced with a custom
filter that adds context-specific information, such as trace request
UUIDs, to each log message. This setup helps in tracking and correlating
log entries within the same context effectively.
