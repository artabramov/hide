"""
This module defines a system for executing various hooks based on
specific actions within the application. It includes the Hook class,
which orchestrates post-event operations by interacting with
EntityManager and CacheManager. The H enumeration specifies different
hook types, and the Hook class manages their execution, handling actions
related to user management, collections, mediafiles, comments, downloads,
and favorites. This setup enables asynchronous processing and integrates
seamlessly with session and caching systems to ensure efficient state
management and responsiveness to application events.
